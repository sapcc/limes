Limes is an OpenStack-compatible quota/usage tracking service, originally designed for SAP's internal cloud.

Pronounce the name like the [Ancient Roman border wall][wp-limes], not like the fruit. (Mnemonic: The original Limes was installed when the Romans wanted to put a quota on Germanic land use.)

## The idea: Automatic quota distribution

Limes can discover capacity and usage for various types of OpenStack resources.
It can then be set up to distribute quota automatically among all projects in a dynamic and automated fashion.
Both cloud admins and project admins have several knobs to control their quota assignments in a controlled fashion.

### Unique features

* Limes records quota changes in the Open Standards [CADF Format](https://www.dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP0262_1.0.0.pdf), and is compatible with other cloud based audit APIs (e.g. [Hermes](https://github.com/sapcc/hermes)).
* Quota and usage data can be exposed as [Prometheus metrics](https://prometheus.io) for monitoring and alerting.
