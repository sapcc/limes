// without needing to hold the entire list of things in memory at once. This is
// especially necessary for large project reports because the JSON can grow to

// hold it all in memory.

// report, we commit to the response being 200 and print reports as they come
// in. If we get to the end, we just need to write the trailing `]}` to
