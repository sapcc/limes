# Example for usage of Limes API

This guide shall introduce you to using the Limes API directly via `curl`.

## Getting a token

If you are not familiar with the standard `openstack` client, please refer to the OpenStack documentation for [how to
install and use it][os-cli]. Assuming that you have provided your credentials to the `openstack client`, get a token
with

```bash
export OS_AUTH_TOKEN="$(openstack token issue -f value -c id)"
```

This command will not print any output if it is successful.

## Finding Limes

Query the service catalog to find the Limes endpoint. It can be identified by looking for the `resources` service type:

```bash
$ openstack catalog list

### Using Limes

In this case, the endpoint URL for Limes is `https://limes.example.com`, so you can build a request URL by appending one
of the paths from the [API specification][v1-api]. For example, to show quota and usage data for a project, use the
following command:

```bash
curl -H "X-Auth-Token: $OS_AUTH_TOKEN" https://limes.example.com/v1/domains/$DOMAIN_ID/projects/$PROJECT_ID
```

`$OS_AUTH_TOKEN` is the token from the first step. `$DOMAIN_ID` and `$PROJECT_ID` need to be set by you to the project
ID in question and its domain ID. If you only have a project name, you can get these IDs by calling `openstack project
show $NAME`.
