# Audit trail

Limes records all events (read: quota changes) at the domain and project level in an Open Standards [CADF format](https://www.dmtf.org/standards/cadf). The log can be used by information auditors or cloud based audit APIs to track events for a resource in a domain or project.

Refer to the [configuration guide](../operators/config.md#audit-trail) for audit trail configuration options.

---

For any given event, the log contains the following details: What, When, Who, From Where, On What, Where, To Where of an activity<sup>*</sup>. This is also referred to as the 7 W’s of audit and compliance.

&ast;*an activity is a type of event that provides information about actions having occurred or intended to occur, and initiated by some resource or done against some resource.*

### The 7 “W”s of audit

| “W” Component | CADF Mandatory Properties  | CADF Optional Properties (where applicable) | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| What | `event.action`<br>`event.outcome`<br>`event.eventType` | `event.reason` | “what” activity occurred; “what” was the result. |
| When | `event.eventTime` || “when” did it happen. |
| Who | `event.initiator.id`<br>`event.initiator.typeURI` | `event.initiator.name` | “who” (person or service) initiated the action. |
| FromWhere || `event.initiator.host`<br>`event.initiator.domain`<br>`event.initiator.domain_id`<br>`event.initiator.project_id` | "FromWhere" provides information describing where the action was initiated from. |
| OnWhat | `event.target.id`<br>`event.target.typeURI`  | `event.target.domain_id`<br>`event.target.project_id` | “onWhat” resource did the activity target. |
| Where | `event.observer.id`<br>`event.observer.typeURI` | `event.observer.name` | “where” did the activity get observed (reported), or modified in some way. |
| ToWhere ||| "ToWhere" provides information describing where the target resource that is affected by the action is located. |
