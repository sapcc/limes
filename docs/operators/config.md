# Configuration guide

Limes requires a configuration file in [YAML format][yaml]. A minimal complete configuration could look like this:

```yaml
api:
  listen: "127.0.0.1:8080"
  policy: "/etc/limes/policy.json"
  cors:
    allowed_origins: [ "https://dashboard.example.com" ]

collector:
  metrics: "127.0.0.1:8081"

clusters:
  staging:
    auth:
      auth_url:            https://keystone.staging.example.com/v3
      user_name:           limes
      user_domain_name:    Default

## Section "database"

Configuration options relating to the database connection of all services.

| Field | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `database.name` | `limes` | The name of the database. |
| `database.username` | `postgres` | Username of the user that Limes should use to connect to the database. |
| `database.password` | *(optional)* | Password for the specified user. |
| `database.hostname` | `localhost` | Hostname of the database server. |
| `database.port` | `5432` | Port on which the PostgreSQL service is running on. |
| `database.connection_options` | *(optional)* | Database connection options. |

Instead of providing `database.password` as plain text in the config file, you
can use a special syntax to read the respective password from an exported
environment variable:

```yaml
password: { fromEnv: ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE }
```

## Section "api"

Configuration options relating to the behavior of the API service.

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `api.listen` | yes | Bind address for the HTTP API exposed by this service, e.g. `127.0.0.1:8080` to bind only on one IP, or `:8080` to bind on all interfaces and addresses. |
| `api.policy` | yes | Path to the oslo.policy file that describes authorization behavior for this service. Please refer to the [OpenStack documentation on policies][policy] for syntax reference. This repository includes an [example policy][ex-pol] that can be used for development setups, or as a basis for writing your own policy. For `:raise`, `:raise_lowpriv`, `:lower` and `:set_rate_limit` policies, the object attribute `%(service_type)s` is available to restrict editing to certain service types. |
| `api.request_log.except_status_codes` | no | A list of HTTP status codes for which requests will not be logged. A useful setting is `[300]` when using `GET /` requests as a healthcheck. |
| `api.cors.allowed_origins` | no | A list of CORS origins from which requests to the API are permitted. |

## Section "collector"

Configuration options relating to the behavior of the collector service.

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `collector.metrics` | yes | Bind address for the Prometheus metrics endpoint provided by this service. See `api.listen` for acceptable values. |
| `collector.data_metrics` | no | If set to `true`, expose all quota/usage/capacity data as Prometheus gauges. This is disabled by default because this can be a lot of data for OpenStack clusters containing many projects, domains and services. |
| `collector.data_metrics_skip_zero` | no | If set to `true`, data metrics will only be emitted for non-zero values. In large deployments, this can substantially reduce the amount of timeseries emitted. |

## Section "clusters"

Configuration options describing the OpenStack clusters which Limes shall cover. `$id` is the internal *cluster ID*, which may be chosen freely, but should not be changed afterwards. (It *can* be changed, but that requires a shutdown of all Limes components and manual editing of the database.)

| Field | Required | Description | Equivalent to |
| --- | --- | --- | :--- |
| `clusters.$id.auth.auth_url` | yes | URL for Keystone v3 API in this cluster. Should end in `/v3`. Other Keystone API versions are not supported. | `$OS_AUTH_URL` |
| `clusters.$id.auth.user_name` | yes | Limes service user. | `OS_USERNAME` |
| `clusters.$id.auth.user_domain_name` | yes | Domain containing Limes service user. | `OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME` |
| `clusters.$id.auth.project_name` | yes | Project where Limes service user has access. | `OS_PROJECT_NAME` |
| `clusters.$id.auth.project_domain_name` | yes | Domain containing that project. | `OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME` |
| `clusters.$id.auth.password` | yes | Password for Limes service user. | `OS_PASSWORD` |
| `clusters.$id.auth.region_name` | no | In multi-region OpenStack clusters, this selects the region to work on. | `OS_REGION_NAME` |
| `clusters.$id.auth.interface` | no | The endpoint type Limes should use for the OpenStack services. | `OS_INTERFACE` |

Instead of providing `clusters.$id.auth.password` as plain text in the config
file, you can use a special syntax to read the respective password from an
exported environment variable:

```yaml
password: { fromEnv: ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE }
```

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `clusters.$id.catalog_url` | no | URL of Limes API service as it appears in the Keystone service catalog for this cluster. This is only used for version advertisements, and can be omitted if no client relies on the URLs in these version advertisements. |
| `clusters.$id.discovery.method` | no | Defines which method to use to discover Keystone domains and projects in this cluster. If not given, the default value is `list`. |
| `clusters.$id.discovery.except_domains` | no | May contain a regex. Domains whose names match the regex will not be considered by Limes. |
| `clusters.$id.discovery.only_domains` | no | May contain a regex. If given, only domains whose names match the regex will be considered by Limes. If `except_domains` is also given, it takes precedence over `only_domains`. |
| `clusters.$id.services` | yes | List of backend services for which to scrape quota/usage data. Service types for which Limes does not include a suitable *quota plugin* will be ignored. See below for supported service types. |
| `clusters.$id.subresources` | no | List of resources where subresource scraping is requested. This is an object with service types as keys, and a list of resource names as values. |
| `clusters.$id.subcapacities` | no | List of resources where subcapacity scraping is requested. This is an object with service types as keys, and a list of resource names as values. |
| `clusters.$id.capacitors` | no | List of capacity plugins to use for scraping capacity data. See below for supported capacity plugins. |
| `clusters.$id.authoritative` | no | If set to `true`, the collector will write the quota from its own database into the backend service whenever scraping encounters a backend quota that differs from the expectation. This flag is strongly recommended in production systems to avoid divergence of Limes quotas from backend quotas, but should be used with care during development. |
| `clusters.$id.constraints` | no | Path to a YAML file containing the quota constraints for this cluster. See [*quota constraints*](constraints.md) for details. |
| `clusters.$id.cadf` | no | Audit trail configuration options. See [*audit trail*](#audit-trail) for details. |
| `clusters.$id.lowpriv_raise` | no | Configuration options for low-privilege quota raising. See [*low-privilege quota raising*](#low-privilege-quota-raising) for details. |
| `clusters.$id.resource_behavior` | no | Configuration options for special resource behaviors. See [*resource behavior*](#resource-behavior) for details. |
| `clusters.$id.bursting.max_multiplier` | no | If given, permits quota bursting in this cluster. When projects enable quota bursting, the backend quota is set to `quota * (1 + max_multiplier)`. In the future, Limes may autonomously adjust the multiplier between 0 and the configured maximum based on cluster-wide resource utilization. |

### Audit trail

Limes logs all quota changes at the domain and project level in an Open Standards [CADF format](https://www.dmtf.org/standards/cadf). These audit events can be sent to a RabbitMQ server which can then forward them to any cloud audit API, datastore, etc.

| Field | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `clusters.$id.cadf.enabled` | `false` | Set this to true if you want to send the audit events to a RabbitMQ server. |
| `clusters.$id.cadf.rabbitmq.queue_name` | *(required, if `enabled` is true)* | Name for the queue that will hold the audit events. The events are published to the default exchange. |
| `clusters.$id.cadf.rabbitmq.username` | `guest` | RabbitMQ Username. |
| `clusters.$id.cadf.rabbitmq.password` | `guest` | Password for the specified user. |
| `clusters.$id.cadf.rabbitmq.hostname` | `localhost` | Hostname of the RabbitMQ server. |
| `clusters.$id.cadf.rabbitmq.port` | `5672` | Port number to which the underlying connection is made. |

### Low-privilege quota raising

The Oslo policy for Limes (see [example policy](../example-policy.json)) is structured such that raising quotas requires
a different (usually higher) permission level than lowering quotas. However, through the `*:raise_lowpriv` rules,
low-privilege users can be permitted to raise quotas within certain boundaries.

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `clusters.$id.lowpriv_raise.limits.projects` | no | Limits up to which project quotas can be raised by a low-privilege user. |
| `clusters.$id.lowpriv_raise.limits.domains` | no | Limits up to which domain quotas can be raised by a low-privilege user. |
| `clusters.$id.lowpriv_raise.except_projects_in_domains` | no | May contain a regex. If given, low-privilege quota raising will not be allowed for projects in domains whose names match the regex. |
| `clusters.$id.lowpriv_raise.only_projects_in_domains` | no | May contain a regex. If given, low-privilege quota raising will only be possible for projects in domains whose names match the regex. If `except_projects_in_domains` is also given, it takes precedence over `only_projects_in_domains`. |

Both `limits.projects` and `limits.domains` contain two-level maps, first by service type, then by resource name.

- Values may also be specified relative to the cluster capacity with the special syntax `<number>% of cluster capacity`.
- For `limits.domains` only, the alternative special syntax `until <number>% of cluster capacity is assigned` will cause
  quota requests to be approved as long as the sum of all domain quotas is below the given value.

For example:

```yaml
clusters:
  example:
    lowpriv_raise:
      limits:
        projects:
          compute:
            cores: 10
            instances: 0.5% of cluster capacity
            ram: 10 GiB
        domains:
          compute:
            cores: 1000
            instances: until 80% of cluster capacity is assigned
            ram: 1 TiB
```

### Resource behavior

Some special behaviors for resources can be configured in the `clusters[].resource_behavior[]` section. Each entry in this section can match multiple resources.

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `clusters.$id.resource_behavior[].resource` | yes | Must contain a regex. The behavior entry applies to all resources where this regex matches against a slash-concatenated pair of service type and resource name. The anchors `^` and `$` are implied at both ends, so the regex must match the entire phrase. |
| `clusters.$id.resource_behavior[].scope` | yes | May contain a regex. The behavior entry applies to matching resources in all domains where this regex matches against the domain name, and in all projects where this regex matches against a slash-concatenated pair of domain and project name, i.e. `domainname/projectname`. The anchors `^` and `$` are implied at both ends, so the regex must match the entire phrase. This regex is ignored for cluster-level resources. |
| `clusters.$id.resource_behavior[].max_burst_multiplier` | no | If given, the bursting multiplier for matching resources will be restricted to this value (see also `clusters.$id.bursting.max_multiplier`). |
| `clusters.$id.resource_behavior[].overcommit_factor` | no | If given, capacity for matching resources will be computed as `raw_capacity * overcommit_factor`, where `raw_capacity` is what the capacity plugin reports. |
| `clusters.$id.resource_behavior[].scales_with` | no | If a resource is given, matching resources scales with this resource. The other resource may be specified by its name (for resources within the same service type), or by a slash-concatenated pair of service type and resource name, e.g. `compute/cores`. |
| `clusters.$id.resource_behavior[].scaling_factor` | yes, if `scales_with` is given | The scaling factor that will be reported for these resources' scaling relation. |
| `clusters.$id.resource_behavior[].min_nonzero_project_quota` | no | A lower boundary for project quota values that are not zero. |
| `clusters.$id.resource_behavior[].annotations` | no | A map of extra key-value pairs that will be inserted into matching resources as-is in responses to GET requests, e.g. at `project.services[].resources[].annotations`. |

For example:

```yaml
clusters:
  example:
    resource_behavior:
      - { resource: network/healthmonitors, scales_with: network/loadbalancers, scaling_factor: 1 }
      - { resource: network/listeners,      scales_with: network/loadbalancers, scaling_factor: 2 }
      - { resource: network/l7policies,     scales_with: network/loadbalancers, scaling_factor: 1 }
      - { resource: network/pools,          scales_with: network/loadbalancers, scaling_factor: 1 }
      # matches both sharev2/share_capacity and sharev2/snapshot_capacity
      - { resource: sharev2/.*_capacity, overcommit_factor: 2 }
      # disable bursting for the domain "foo"
      - { resource: .*, scope: foo/.*, max_burst_multiplier: 0 }
      # require each project to take at least 100 GB of object storage if they use it at all
      - { resource: object-store/capacity, min_nonzero_project_quota: 107374182400 }
```

# Supported discovery methods

This section lists all supported discovery methods for Keystone domains and projects.

## Method: `list` (default)

```yaml
discovery:
  method: list
```

When this method is configured, Limes will simply list all Keystone domains and projects with the standard API calls, equivalent to what the CLI commands `openstack domain list` and `openstack project list --domain $DOMAIN_ID` do.

## Method: `role-assignment`

```yaml
discovery:
  method: role-assignment
  role-assignment:
    role: swiftoperator
```

When this method is configured, Limes will only consider those Keystone projects where the configured role is assigned to at least one user or group. Role assignments to domains are not considered.

This method is useful when there are a lot of projects (e.g. more than 10 000), but only a few of them (e.g. a few dozen) need to be considered by Limes. Since this method requires one API call per project (times the number of domains) every three minutes, it is not advisable when a lot of projects need to be considered by Limes.

# Supported service types

This section lists all supported service types and the resources that are understood for each service. The `type` string is always equal to the one that appears in the Keystone service catalog.

For each service, `shared: true` can be set to indicate that the resources of this service are shared among all clusters that specify this service type. For example:

```yaml
services:
  # unshared service
  - type: compute
  # shared service
  - type: object-store
    shared: true
```

For each service, an `auth:` section can be given to provide alternative credentials for operations on this service type
(i.e. get quota/usage, set quota). This is particularly useful for shared services, when the service user with the
required permissions is in a different cluster than the one for which quotas are managed. The structure is the same as
for `clusters.$id.auth`. For example:

```yaml
services:
  - type: compute
  - type: object-store
    shared: true
    auth:
      auth_url:            https://keystone.staging.example.com/v3
      user_name:           limes
      user_domain_name:    Default
      project_name:        service
      project_domain_name: Default
      password:            swordfish
      region_name:         staging
```

## `compute`: Nova v2

```yaml
services:
  - type: compute
```

The area for this service is `compute`.

| Resource | Unit |
| --- | --- |
| `cores` | countable |
| `instances` | countable |
| `ram` | MiB |
| `server_groups` | countable |
| `server_group_members` | countable |

### Instance price classes

```yaml
services:
  - type: compute
    compute:
      bigvm_min_memory: 1048576
```

Instances can be split into two price groups (regular and big VMs) by setting the `compute.bigvm_min_memory` key as
shown above. When enabled, the following extra resources become available:

| Resource | Unit |
| --- | --- |
| `cores_regular` | countable |
| `cores_bigvm` | countable |
| `instances_regular` | countable |
| `instances_bigvm` | countable |
| `ram_regular` | MiB |
| `ram_bigvm` | MiB |

Those resources don't track quota; only usage will be reported. Each of these resources has a `contained_in` relation,
e.g. `instances_regular` is `contained_in: "instances"`.

Note that, as of now, this configuration is laser-focused on one specific usecase in SAP Converged Cloud. It might
become more generic once I have more than this singular usecase and a general pattern arises.

### Instance subresources

The `instances` resource supports subresource scraping. Subresources bear the following attributes:

| Attribute | Type | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | instance UUID |
| `name` | string | instance name |
| `status` | string | instance status [as reported by OpenStack Nova](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/VMState) |
| `flavor` | string | flavor name (not ID!) |
| `ram` | integer value with unit | amount of memory configured in flavor |
| `vcpu` | integer | number of vCPUs configured in flavor |
| `disk` | integer value with unit | root disk size configured in flavor |
| `class` | string | either "regular" or "bigvm" (only if instance price classes are enabled, see above) |
| `os_type` | string | identifier for OS type as configured in image (see below) |
| `hypervisor` | string | identifier for the hypervisor type of this instance (only if configured, see below) |

The `os_type` field contains:
- for VMware images: the value of the `vmware_ostype` property of the instance's image, or
- otherwise: the part after the colon of a tag starting with `ostype:`, e.g. `rhel` if there is a tag `ostype:rhel` on the image.

The value of the `hypervisor` field is determined by looking at the extra specs of the instance's flavor, using matching
rules supplied in the configuration like this:

```yaml
services:
  - type: compute
    compute:
      hypervisor_type_rules:
        - match: extra-spec:vmware:hv_enabled # match on extra spec with name "vmware:hv_enabled"
          pattern: '^True$'                   # regular expression
          type: vmware
        - match: flavor-name
          pattern: '^kvm'
          type: kvm
        - match: extra-spec:capabilities:cpu_arch
          pattern: '.+'
          type: none # i.e. bare-metal
```

Rules are evaluated in the order given, and the first matching rule will be taken. If no rule matches, the hypervisor
will be reported as `unknown`. If rules cannot be evaluated because the instance's flavor has been deleted, the
hypervisor will be reported as `flavor-deleted`.

### Separate instance quotas

On SAP Converged Cloud (or any other OpenStack cluster where Nova carries the relevant patches), there will be an
additional resource `instances_<flavorname>` for each flavor with the `quota:separate = true` extra spec. These resources
behave like the `instances` resource. When subresources are scraped for the `instances` resource, they will also be
scraped for these flavor-specific instance resources. The flavor-specific instance resources are in the `per_flavor`
category.

```yaml
services:
  - type: compute
    compute:
      separate_instance_quotas:
        flavor_name_pattern: ^z
```

Sometimes Tempest creates resource classes or flavors that Limes recognizes as requiring a separate instance quota,
which may not be desired. To control which flavors get a separate instance quota, give the
`compute.separate_instance_quotas.flavor_name_pattern` option as shown above. Only flavors with a name matching that
regex will be considered.

## `database`: SAP Cloud Frame Manager

```yaml
services:
  - type: database
```

The area for this service is `storage`.

| Resource | Unit |
| --- | --- |
| `cfm_share_capacity` | bytes |

## `dns`: Designate v2

```yaml
services:
  - type: dns
```

The area for this service is `dns`.

| Resource | Unit |
| --- | --- |
| `recordsets` | countable |
| `zones` | countable |

When the `recordsets` quota is set, the backend quota for records is set to 20 times that value, to fit into the `records_per_recordset` quota (which is set to 20 by default in Designate). The record quota cannot be controlled explicitly in Limes.

## `email-aws`: Cronus v1 (SAP Converged Cloud only)

```yaml
services:
  - type: email-aws
```

The area for this service is `email`. This service has no resources, only rates.

| Rate | Unit | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `attachments_size` | bytes | Size of attachments for outgoing emails. |
| `data_transfer_in` | bytes | Total size of incoming emails. |
| `data_transfer_out` | bytes | Total size of outgoing emails. |
| `recipients` | countable | Number of recipients on outgoing emails. |

## `keppel`: Keppel v1

```
services:
  - type: keppel
```

The area for this service is `storage`.

| Resource | Unit |
| --- | --- |
| `images` | countable |

## `network`: Neutron v1

```yaml
services:
  - type: network
```

The area for this service is `network`. Resources are categorized into `networking` for SDN resources and `loadbalancing` for LBaaS resources.

| Category | Resource | Unit | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `networking` | `floating_ips` | countable ||
|| `networks` | countable ||
|| `ports` | countable ||
|| `rbac_policies` | countable ||
|| `routers` | countable ||
|| `security_group_rules` | countable | See note about auto-approval below. |
|| `security_groups` | countable | See note about auto-approval below. |
|| `subnet_pools` | countable ||
|| `subnets` | countable ||
| `loadbalancing` | `healthmonitors` | countable ||
|| `l7policies` | countable ||
|| `listeners` | countable ||
|| `loadbalancers` | countable ||
|| `pools` | countable ||

When a new project is scraped for the first time, and usage for `security_groups` and `security_group_rules` is 1 and 4,
respectively, quota of the same size is approved automatically. This covers the `default` security group that is
automatically created in a new project.

## `object-store`: Swift v1

```yaml
services:
  - type: object-store
```

The area for this service is `storage`.

| Resource | Unit |
| --- | --- |
| `capacity` | Bytes |

## `sharev2`: Manila v2

```yaml
services:
  - type: sharev2
    sharev2:
      share_types:
        - name: default
          replication_enabled: true
        - name: hypervisor_storage
      prometheus_api:
          url: https://prometheus.example.com
          cert:    /path/to/client.pem
          key:     /path/to/client-key.pem
          ca_cert: /path/to/server-ca.pem
```

The area for this service is `storage`. The following resources are always exposed:

| Resource | Unit | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `shares` | countable | |
| `share_capacity` | GiB | |
| `share_snapshots` | countable | |
| `snapshot_capacity` | GiB | |
| `share_networks` | countable | |

If the `sharev2.share_types` field lists more than one share type, the
first six of the aforementioned seven resources will refer to the quota for the
first of these share types. (This peculiar rule exists for
backwards-compatibility reasons.) For each other share type, the following
resources are exposed:

| Resource | Unit | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `shares_${share_type}` | countable | |
| `share_capacity_${share_type}` | GiB | |
| `share_snapshots_${share_type}` | countable | |
| `snapshot_capacity_${share_type}` | GiB | |

The quota values in Manila are assigned as follows:

- When share replica quotas are available (in Victoria and above), share types
  that have `replication_enabled: true` in our configuration will have their
  replica and replica capacity quotas set to the same value as the share and
  share capacity quotas. (This makes sense since the shares themselves also use
  up replica quota.) If `replication_enabled` is false or unset, the replica
  quotas will not be set.
- Besides the share-type-specific quotas, the general quotas are set to the sum
  across all share types.

### Physical usage

Optionally, when the `sharev2.prometheus_api` configuration option is set,
physical usage data will be scraped using the Prometheus metrics exported by
the [netapp-api-exporter](https://github.com/sapcc/netapp-api-exporter).

Only the `prometheus_api.url` field is required. You can pin the server's CA
certificate (`prometheus_api.ca_cert`) and/or specify a TLS client certificate
(`prometheus_api.cert`) and private key (`prometheus_api.key`) combination that
will be used by the HTTP client to make requests to the Prometheus API.

## `volumev2`: Cinder v2

```yaml
services:
  - type: volumev2
    volumev2:
      volume_types: [ vmware, vmware_hdd ]
```

The area for this service is `storage`. The following resources are always exposed:

| Resource | Unit |
| --- | --- |
| `capacity` | GiB |
| `snapshots` | countable |
| `volumes` | countable |

If the `volumev2.volume_types` field lists more than one volume type, the
aforementioned resources will refer to the quota for the first of these volume
types. (This peculiar rule exists for backwards-compatibility reasons.) For
each other volume type, the following resources are exposed:

| Resource | Unit |
| --- | --- |
| `capacity_${volume_type}` | GiB |
| `snapshots_${volume_type}` | countable |
| `volumes_${volume_type}` | countable |

In Cinder, besides the volume-type-specific quotas, the general quotas
(`gigabytes`, `snapshots`, `volumes`) are set to the sum across all volume
types.

The `volumes` and `volumes_${volume_type}` resources supports subresource
scraping. Subresources bear the following attributes:

| Attribute | Type | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | volume UUID |
| `name` | string | volume name |
| `status` | string | volume status [as reported by OpenStack Cinder](https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/block-storage/v2/index.html#volumes-volumes) |
| `size` | integer value with unit | volume size |

# Available capacity plugins

Note that capacity for a resource only becomes visible when the corresponding service is enabled in the
`clusters.$id.services` list as well.

For each capacitor, an `auth:` section can be given to provide alternative credentials for read operations performed by
this capacitor. This is particularly useful for shared services, when the service user with the required permissions is
in a different cluster than the one for which quotas are managed. The structure is the same as for `clusters.$id.auth`.
For example:

```yaml
capacitors:
  - id: nova
  - id: cinder
    auth:
      auth_url:            https://keystone.staging.example.com/v3
      user_name:           limes
      user_domain_name:    Default
      project_name:        service
      project_domain_name: Default
      password:            swordfish
      region_name:         staging
    cinder:
      volume_types:
        vmware:     { volume_backend_name: vmware_ssd, default: true }
        vmware_hdd: { volume_backend_name: vmware_hdd, default: false }
```

## `cfm`

```yaml
capacitors:
  - id: cfm
```

| Resource | Method |
| --- | --- |
| `database/cfm_share_capacity` | Calculated as `sum(pool.capabilities.total_capacity)` over all pools. |

## `cinder`

```yaml
capacitors:
  - id: cinder
    cinder:
      volume_types:
        vmware:     { volume_backend_name: vmware_ssd, default: true }
        vmware_hdd: { volume_backend_name: vmware_hdd, default: false }
```

| Resource | Method |
| --- | --- |
| `volumev2/capacity` | The sum over all pools reported by Cinder with `volume_backend_name` matching that of the default volume type. |
| `volumev2/capacity_${volume_type}` | The sum over all pools reported by Cinder with `volume_backend_name` matching that of the given non-default volume type. |

No estimates are made for the `snapshots` and `volumes` resources since capacity highly depends on
the concrete Cinder backend.

## `manila`

```yaml
capacitors:
- id: manila
  manila:
    share_types: [ default, hypervisor_storage ]
    share_networks: 250
    shares_per_pool: 1000
    snapshots_per_share: 5
    capacity_balance: 0.5
```

| Resource | Method |
| --- | --- |
| `sharev2/share_networks` | Taken from identically-named configuration parameter. |
| `sharev2/shares` | Calculated as `shares_per_pool * count(pools) - share_networks`. |
| `sharev2/share_snapshots` | Calculated as `snapshots_per_share` times the above value. |
| `sharev2/share_capacity`<br>`sharev2/snapshot_capacity` | Calculated as `sum(pool.capabilities.totalCapacityGB)`, then divided among those two resources according to the `capacity_balance` (see below). |

The last four of these five resources consider only pools with the share type
that appears first in `manila.share_types` (to match the behavior of the quota
plugin). For any other share type listed in `manila.share_types`, capacities
will be reported analogously for `sharev2/shares_${share_type}` etc. by
considering pools with that share type.

### Capacity balance

The capacity balance is defined as

```
snapshot_capacity = capacity_balance * share_capacity,
```

that is, there is `capacity_balance` as much snapshot capacity as there is share capacity. For example, `capacity_balance = 0.5` means that the capacity for snapshots is half as big as that for shares, meaning that shares get 2/3 of the total capacity and snapshots get the other 1/3.

## `manual`

```yaml
capacitors:
  - id: manual
    manual:
      network:
        floating_ips: 8192
        networks: 4096
```

The `manual` capacity plugin does not query any backend service for capacity data. It just reports the capacity data
that is provided in the configuration file in the `manual` key. Values are grouped by service, then by resource.

This is useful for capacities that cannot be queried automatically, but can be inferred from domain knowledge. Limes
also allows to configure such capacities via the API, but operators might prefer the `manual` capacity plugin because it
allows to track capacity values along with other configuration in a Git repository or similar.

## `nova`

```yaml
capacitors:
  - id: nova
    nova:
      hypervisor_type_pattern: '^(?:VMware|QEMU)'
      extra_specs:
        first: 'foo'
        second: 'bar'
      use_placement_api: true
subcapacities:
  - compute/cores
  - compute/instances
  - compute/ram
```

| Resource | Method |
| --- | --- |
| `compute/cores` | The sum of the reported CPUs for all hypervisors. Note that the hypervisor statistics reported by Nova do not take overcommit into account, so you may have to configure the overcommitment again in Limes for accurate capacity reporting. |
| `compute/instances` | Estimated as `10000 * count(availabilityZones)`, but never more than `sumLocalDisk / maxDisk`, where `sumLocalDisk` is the sum of the local disk size for all hypervisors, and `maxDisk` is the largest disk requirement of all flavors. |
| `compute/ram` | The sum of the reported RAM for all hypervisors. |

If the `nova.hypervisor_type_pattern` parameter is set, only those hypervisors are considered whose `hypervisor_type`
matches this regex. Note that this is distinct from the `hypervisor_type_rules` used by the `compute` quota plugin, and
uses the `hypervisor_type` reported by Nova instead.

The `nova.extra_specs` parameter can be used to control how flavors are enumerated. Only those flavors will be
considered which have all the extra specs noted in this map, with the same values as defined in the configuration file.
This is particularly useful to filter Ironic flavors, which usually have much larger root disk sizes.

If the `nova.use_placement_api` parameter is set, capacity and usage data is gathered from the Placement API instead of
from Nova's hypervisor list. The data from the Placement API is usually more reliable, but the Placement API may not be
available in all OpenStack installations, so it remains opt-in for now.

When subcapacity scraping is enabled (as shown above), subcapacities will be scraped for the respective resources. Each
subcapacity corresponds to one Nova aggregate. If the `nova.hypervisor_type_pattern` parameter is set, only the capacity
of matching hypervisors will be considered for each aggregate. Aggregates with no matching hypervisor will not be
considered. Note that summing all subcapacities may yield a greater value than the actual capacity since one hypervisor
may belong to multiple aggregates. Subcapacities bear the following attributes:

| Attribute | Type | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | aggregate name as reported by Nova |
| `metadata` | object of strings | aggregate metadata as reported by Nova |
| `capacity` | integer | sum of capacity of all matching hypervisors in this aggregate |

## `prometheus`

```yaml
capacitors:
  - id: prometheus
    prometheus:
      api:
        url: https://prometheus.example.com
        cert:    /path/to/client.pem
        key:     /path/to/client-key.pem
        ca_cert: /path/to/server-ca.pem
      queries:
        compute:
          cores:     sum(hypervisor_cores)
          ram:       sum(hypervisor_ram_gigabytes) * 1024
```

Like the `manual` capacity plugin, this plugin can provide capacity values for arbitrary resources. A [Prometheus][prom]
instance must be running at the URL given in `prometheus.api.url`. Each of the queries in `prometheus.queries` is
executed on this Prometheus instance, and the resulting value is reported as capacity for the resource named by the key
of this query. Queries are grouped by service, then by resource.

In `prometheus.api`, only the `url` field is required. You can pin the server's CA
certificate (`prometheus.api.ca_cert`) and/or specify a TLS client certificate
(`prometheus.api.cert`) and private key (`prometheus.api.key`) combination that
will be used by the HTTP client to make requests to the Prometheus API.

For example, the following configuration can be used with [swift-health-statsd][shs] to find the net capacity of a Swift cluster with 3 replicas:

```yaml
capacitors:
  - id: prometheus
    prometheus:
      api_url: https://prometheus.example.com
      queries:
        object-store:
          capacity: min(swift_cluster_storage_capacity_bytes < inf) / 3
```

## `sapcc-ironic`

```yaml
capacitors:
  - id: sapcc-ironic
```

This capacity plugin reports capacity for the special `compute/instances_<flavorname>` resources that exist on SAP
Converged Cloud ([see above](#compute-nova-v2)). For each such flavor, it counts the number of Ironic nodes whose RAM
size, disk size, number of cores, and capabilities match those in the flavor.

```yaml
capacitors:
  - id: sapcc-ironic
subcapacities:
  - compute: [ instances-baremetal ]
```

When the "compute/instances-baremetal" pseudo-resource is set up for subcapacity scraping (as shown above),
subcapacities will be scraped for all resources reported by this plugin. Subcapacities correspond to Ironic nodes and
bear the following attributes:

| Attribute | Type | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | node UUID |
| `name` | string | node name |
| `ram` | integer value with unit | amount of memory |
| `cores` | integer | number of CPU cores |
| `disk` | integer value with unit | root disk size |
| `serial` | string | hardware serial number for node |

## Rate Limits

Rate limits can be configured per service on 2 levels: `global` and `project_default` as outlined below.
For further details see the [rate limits API specification](../users/api-v1-specification.md#rate-limits).

| Attribute | Type | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `global` | list |  Defines rate limits meant to protect the service from being overloaded. Requests are counted across all domains and projects. |
| `project_default` | list | Defines default rate limits for every project. |
| `$level[].name` | string | The name of the rate. |
| `$level[].unit` | string | The unit of the rate. Available units are `B`, `KiB`, `MiB` and so on. If not given, the resource is counted (e.g. API requests) rather than measured. |
| `$level[].limit` | integer | The rate limit as integer. |

Example configuration:

```yaml
clusters:
  staging:
    services:
      - type: object-store
        rates:
          global:
           - name:   services/swift/account/container/object:create
             limit:  1000000
             window: "1s"
          project_default:
           - name:   services/swift/account/container/object:create
             limit:  1000
             window: "1s"
```
